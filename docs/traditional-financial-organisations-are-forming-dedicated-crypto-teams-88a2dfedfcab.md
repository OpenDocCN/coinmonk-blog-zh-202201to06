专家预测，随着更多的金融巨头建立密码研究团队，这一趋势将在未来继续加快步伐。

尽管在过去的一两个月里，金融不稳定已经吞噬了全球经济格局，但加密货币市场，尤其是不可伪造的代币(NFT)领域，似乎仍有增无减。自 2021 年初以来，crypto 的总市值已从约 8000 亿美元攀升至 1.8 万亿美元，这一事实体现了这一趋势。

此外，根据 NonFungible.com 上个月底发布的一份报告，2021 年 NFT 市场的销售额飙升至 176 亿美元的历史新高，比 2020 年增长了 21，000%。根据这项研究，去年参与 NFT 市场的个人获得了价值 54 亿美元的巨额收益。因此，越来越多的传统公司开始进入加密领域也就不足为奇了。

**主流公司正在调查加密技术**

野村控股(Nomura Holdings)是日本最大的金融公司之一，管理着约 70 万亿日元(5930 亿美元)的资产，该公司于 3 月 2 日宣布将成立一个新的数字资产部门，以调查加密市场(尤其是 NFT)带来的机遇，并帮助其客户增加对数字货币和其他相关服务的接触和使用。该公司经营零售、批发和投资业务，宣布其未来的创新公司将进行重组，更新活动将于 4 月开始。最近几个月，几家大公司也采取了类似的举措，包括电子商务巨头乐天，它宣布建立自己的 NFT 交易平台，名为乐天 NFT。日本最大的金融集团三菱 UFJ 金融集团也宣布将放弃其区块链支付项目，以专注于蓬勃发展的稳定币行业。

**The use of specialised crypto wings is quickly becoming the standard**

Christopher Temme, the chief financial officer of cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer USA, spoke on whether the trend of mainstream companies establishing specialised crypto departments will continue.

Clients of most international firms are seeking for this kind of exposure, therefore companies like Nomura forming digital asset-focused business units comes as no surprise to him, adding:

**“What’s more intriguing is that Nomura is focusing on NFTs in particular.” Their quick growth and adoption in the creative/collectibles arena has served as the ideal proving ground for hardening the technology in readiness for digital ownership of’real’ property and the communities that will emerge as a result.”**

While Japanese financial organisations have historically been cautious in their financial views, Temme believes that the fact that Nomura is researching the crypto industry through a dedicated wing is a significant indicator of what’s to come in the near future.

Similarly, Takaaki Kato, head of global sales and trading at bitFlyer, told that mainstream corporations tend to follow a herd mentality, which means that if one major player opens a crypto department, it’s only a matter of time until others do the same.

Jimmy Yin, the founder of iZUMi Finance, a platform that provides liquidity as a service, agreed with Temme and Kato, telling that the construction of dedicated crypto wings will likely become the standard as we progress toward a more decentralised future. However, he pointed out that there are a few factors that businesses should think about before taking large moves in this direction:

**“Over the last year, we’ve seen significant growth in NFTs and crypto-asset consumers in general.” However, a variety of considerations, including legalisation, must be considered, particularly when advertising to a large audience. With the current geopolitical chaos, crypto is perceived as a threat to what has previously been considered stable.”**

According to Yin, the movement will gain traction if crypto’s social acceptance grows, particularly as a holistic technology that offers a wide range of benefits — not simply as a payment instrument. “Whether crypto becomes a social norm is not up to these corporate behemoths, but rather the common good of citizens,” he stated.

**The figures don’t lie**

Bank of America formed a specific team focused on crypto and digital asset strategy in mid-2021, citing increased customer demand and other related variables as reasons for the move. Analysts stated in a research issued later that year that the digital asset market had grown too huge for any forward-thinking organisation to ignore, with crypto reaching a market valuation of $2 trillion in 2021 — and boasting over 200 million users.

In the coming months and years, crypto-based digital assets might form a completely new asset class, according to the experts. Not only that, but they acknowledged that the digital asset ecosystem had expanded into previously unimaginable realms in recent years, including decentralised finance, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), implying that more traditional players will soon join the fray.

In terms of pure statistics, venture capital-related digital asset and blockchain investments totaled over $17 billion in Q1 and Q2 of 2021, much surpassing the combined sum of $5.5 billion the previous year.

Finally, as more businesses recognise the value of crypto in a variety of areas, such as finance, supply chains, gaming, and social media, the creation of dedicated crypto research teams is becoming a reality. According to Samiar Tehrani, co-founder of Ratio Finance, a Solana-based collateralized debt position platform, digital assets present real, ready-to-use use cases that address many of the issues faced by traditional finance.

**“Even after multiple large drops recently, the crypto sector’s current market capitalization is $1.8 trillion, which is higher than the GDP of several major countries.” That tells you everything you need to know about the size of the market and whether or not corporations are taking it seriously. Most organisations, I believe, already have dedicated teams working overtime to investigate this region in order to avoid being left behind.”**

**Cryptocurrency has a lot of value in the eyes of most traditional businesses**

Many other banking behemoths, like Bank of America, have recently plunged into the crypto market’s deep end. Morgan Stanley, for example, formed a cryptocurrency research team late last year, led by Sheena Shah, the bank’s lead digital asset analyst, and Adam Wood and James Faucette, the bank’s fintech and payments research teams in Europe and the US, respectively.

Morgan Stanley was also one of the first large investment banks to completely embrace digital currencies, with the firm offering a total of 15 crypto-related mutual funds to its clients over the last 18 months.

In June 2021, State Street, the second-oldest continuously operating bank in the United States, launched a dedicated digital finance division, citing the need to focus on future-centric technologies like cryptocurrency, blockchain, CBDCs, and tokenization in order to keep up with the ever-changing global financial landscape.

As the world moves toward the use of digital assets, it stands to reason that more businesses will examine the many products available in the field. In this sense, it appears that many businesses believe that forming teams specialising in this financial area is the best way to go.

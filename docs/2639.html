However, he pointed out that there are a few factors that businesses should think about before taking large moves in this direction:<br/><br/><strong class="jf hu">“Over the last year, we’ve seen significant growth in NFTs and crypto-asset consumers in general.” However, a variety of considerations, including legalisation, must be considered, particularly when advertising to a large audience. With the current geopolitical chaos, crypto is perceived as a threat to what has previously been considered stable.”</strong><br/><br/>According to Yin, the movement will gain traction if crypto’s social acceptance grows, particularly as a holistic technology that offers a wide range of benefits — not simply as a payment instrument. “Whether crypto becomes a social norm is not up to these corporate behemoths, but rather the common good of citizens,” he stated.<br/><br/> <br/> <br/><strong class="jf hu">The figures don’t lie</strong><br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Bank of America formed a specific team focused on crypto and digital asset strategy in mid-2021, citing increased customer demand and other related variables as reasons for the move. Analysts stated in a research issued later that year that the digital asset market had grown too huge for any forward-thinking organisation to ignore, with crypto reaching a market valuation of $2 trillion in 2021 — and boasting over 200 million users.<br/><br/>In the coming months and years, crypto-based digital assets might form a completely new asset class, according to the experts. Not only that, but they acknowledged that the digital asset ecosystem had expanded into previously unimaginable realms in recent years, including decentralised finance, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), implying that more traditional players will soon join the fray.<br/><br/>In terms of pure statistics, venture capital-related digital asset and blockchain investments totaled over $17 billion in Q1 and Q2 of 2021, much surpassing the combined sum of $5.5 billion the previous year.<br/><br/>Finally, as more businesses recognise the value of crypto in a variety of areas, such as finance, supply chains, gaming, and social media, the creation of dedicated crypto research teams is becoming a reality. According to Samiar Tehrani, co-founder of Ratio Finance, a Solana-based collateralized debt position platform, digital assets present real, ready-to-use use cases that address many of the issues faced by traditional finance.<br/><br/><strong class="jf hu">“Even after multiple large drops recently, the crypto sector’s current market capitalization is $1.8 trillion, which is higher than the GDP of several major countries.” That tells you everything you need to know about the size of the market and whether or not corporations are taking it seriously. Most organisations, I believe, already have dedicated teams working overtime to investigate this region in order to avoid being left behind.”</strong><br/><br/><strong class="jf hu">Cryptocurrency has a lot of value in the eyes of most traditional businesses</strong><br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Many other banking behemoths, like Bank of America, have recently plunged into the crypto market’s deep end. Morgan Stanley, for example, formed a cryptocurrency research team late last year, led by Sheena Shah, the bank’s lead digital asset analyst, and Adam Wood and James Faucette, the bank’s fintech and payments research teams in Europe and the US, respectively.<br/><br/>Morgan Stanley was also one of the first large investment banks to completely embrace digital currencies, with the firm offering a total of 15 crypto-related mutual funds to its clients over the last 18 months.<br/><br/>In June 2021, State Street, the second-oldest continuously operating bank in the United States, launched a dedicated digital finance division, citing the need to focus on future-centric technologies like cryptocurrency, blockchain, CBDCs, and tokenization in order to keep up with the ever-changing global financial landscape.<br/><br/>As the world moves toward the use of digital assets, it stands to reason that more businesses will examine the many products available in the field. In this sense, it appears that many businesses believe that forming teams specialising in this financial area is the best way to go.<br/><br/> <strong class="jf hu">Visit our website:- </strong><a class="ae jc" href="https://bitcoinsupports.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong class="jf hu">https://bitcoinsupports.com/</strong></a><br/><br/><strong class="jf hu">Disclaimer: These are the writer’s opinions and should not be considered investment advice.

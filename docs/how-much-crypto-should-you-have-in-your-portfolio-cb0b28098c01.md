Coins and tokens abound in the cryptocurrency realm, all vying for your attention as a prospective investment. It will be challenging for you to decide which assets to put in your portfolio as an investor. While it is subjective and varies depending on a person’s risk appetite and financial demands, you can always strike a balance to preserve your assets while maximising long-term gains.

Astute investors have gotten a better knowledge of the groundbreaking ideas and technologies that underpin Bitcoin during the last decade. It reminds me of the internet’s early days in the 1990s. We all knew the internet will affect the way we live, but it was difficult to predict how our lives would change and which new companies would drive that shift at the time.

Since its beginnings in 2009, advisors have been sceptical about cryptocurrencies. It’s understandable: Advisors can’t simply log on to Kraken, Gemini, or Coinbase and add a modest amount of cryptocurrency to their clients’ portfolios, some of which they’ve been managing for decades, due to regulatory restrictions.

**A Perfect Portfolio in the Opinions of Advisors**

According to Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), advisors’ notions about good portfolio management are founded on modern portfolio theory. Nobel Laureates like as Harry Markowitz, William Sharpe, and Eugene Fama helped shape this concept. According to behavioural finance theory, if you’re not going to make a meaningful allocation in your portfolio, you shouldn’t make one at all. According to Edelman,

“Advisors run highly profitable businesses and manage a lot of money.” They’re in charge of hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, and they’re doing a fantastic job. ‘Buy one share of Microsoft,’ no financial expert would ever tell a client. What’s the goal of it all? It’s not going to shift the needle if you don’t make a meaningful allocation.”

According to Yale research published in 2019, bitcoin should account for 4% to 6% of the value of a portfolio. The study looked at all cryptos, with a particular focus on Bitcoin, XRP, and ether. Financial counsellors, professional financial planners, and other money specialists are increasingly working together to advocate for a 1% to 5% crypto asset allocation. Furthermore, the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro invested 1% of its treasury reserves in cryptocurrencies earlier this month, serving as an interesting case study on a municipal level.

A one percent allocation, according to Edelman, is a wonderful sweet spot. It’s small enough that a market drop would be almost imperceptible, but it still puts normal investors at risk of quadrupling their returns. Consumers and advisors are naturally holding their breath as the amount of institutional crypto investment looks to be lessening the chance of a catastrophic crash. As a result, Edelman claims that 1% of a contribution is sufficient to be considered “significant.”

**Bitcoin is an absolute must-have.**

You must acquire knowledge that will enable you to establish a cryptocurrency portfolio as you begin your adventure into the world of cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, accounting for 45 percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. That is, the price of Bitcoin continues to have a substantial impact on market direction. The simplest way to start a cryptocurrency portfolio is to put at least 60% of your money into Bitcoin, followed by a stake in Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency.

The ideal portfolio for risk-adjusted future returns is 75 percent Bitcoin and 25 percent Ethereum, according to math. You can invest in the top 20 cryptocurrencies after knowing how the top two cryptocurrencies work for a few months (you listed on coinmarketcap.com). You can invest in currencies with a 10x or 20x potential over time and with confidence outside of the top 20, however the risk is higher.

This pattern was applied to a hypothetical case in which the asset mix was 60/40, as defined by Edelman. Around the period of Bitcoin’s amazing 2017 bull run, data shows a 1,500 percent price surge, followed by an 84 percent drop. Due to compound interest, a portfolio without Bitcoin would return around 7% in a year (estimated conservatively) and 14.5 percent in two years. If the asset allocation is altered to 59/40/1 (with a 1% addition of crypto), the potential gains may be 22 percent in year 1 and 15.4 percent in year 2 (with the 85 percent depreciation), resulting in a net profit.

Other London-listed equities, including as Lukoil, Novatek, and Rosneft, were also hammered hard. The currency of Russia has plummeted to less than a cent ($0.0098).<br/><br/>In response to the senators’ worries, Jake Chervinsky, the head of policy at the Blockchain Association, a Washington-based trade group, took to Twitter to explain that cryptocurrencies cannot be used to overcome penalties.<br/><br/><a class="ae jg" href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1498786025438650369" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em class="kf">https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1498786025438650369<br/></em></a> <br/>“US citizens around the world, regardless of what payment systems they were using earlier, are cutting relations with Russian right now,” he wrote.<br/> <br/>“There’s no reason to believe that the existence of cryptocurrency will persuade any of them to willfully break sanctions rules, incurring fines and jail time.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, aggrieved Russian oligarchs and businesses seeking financial refuge are said to have reacted positively to cryptocurrency.<br/><br/>The senators wrote in their letter that “trading volumes between the Russian ruble and Bitcoin have surged to their highest level since May 2021 in recent days following the flurry of punitive announcements.”<br/><br/>Democrats are asking for more from the crypto community.<br/><br/>The letter also gives concrete examples of what the US considers to be the crypto community’s disrespect for banking regulations.<br/><br/>In May, mining business Marathon Digital refused to accept transactions from wallets identified on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, only to backtrack in June.<br/><br/>OFAC is the Treasury Department’s financial intelligence and enforcement office, tasked with issuing and enforcing sanctions in accordance with US foreign policy and national security goals.<br/><br/>DeFi and its use of smart contracts, which seek to replace brokers, banks, and financial intermediaries, were also mentioned as a growing threat to financial stability and sanctions restrictions.<br/><br/>According to the letter, “the cryptocurrency business may not be fulfilling its responsibilities to comply with US sanctions.” “Many “members of the virtual currency sector implement OFAC sanctions policies and procedures months, if not years, after commencing operations,” according to OFAC’s October advice.<br/><br/>As a result, the four Democrats said they want to know what steps the Treasury Department plans to take in response to OFAC’s recommendations on enforcing sanctions compliance by crypto players.<br/><br/>Senators also posed questions to the Treasury Department, including how OFAC collaborates with foreign governments to ensure crypto does not circumvent sanctions, the problems the agency faces under the October directive, and the number of self-disclosed sanctions violations.<br/><br/>Two other questions were posed, one about how DeFi’s (decentralised finance) expansion has aided “maligned actors’” ability to circumvent sanctions and the agency’s ability to enforce them, and the other about what more legal tools and money are needed to prevent Russia’s evasions.<br/><br/>Senators are asking for a response to their queries as well as further material by March 23.</p><p id="dd2f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jh ji ht jj b jk jl jm
